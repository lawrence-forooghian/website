# Jobs

## Brazil

- [Work in Brazil â€“ Prospects.ac.uk](https://www.prospects.ac.uk/jobs-and-work-experience/working-abroad/work-in-brazil) - lists some job sites
- Alice (healthcare plan) is hiring
- As is [Stripe](https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/backend-api-engineer-latam/2287232)

## Remote working opportunities

Was speaking to James S about these possibilities:

- Automattic (they make WordPress etc)
- DuckDuckGo
- GitHub
- Auth0
- Mozilla
- Zapier

A [6Nomads guide to remote hiring](https://6nomads.com/howtohire), which mentions Brazil

Also saw:

- Glitch (make websites in the browser)

I wonder what about Mapbox?

An [interesting HN thread ("Anyone working remotely for a US company internationally?")](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28955562), which talks about opportunities, disguised employment, local tax laws, international umbrella companies etc.

Torchbox make Wagtail and also do consulting on it, seemingly to a bunch of NGOs / gov

There's also a website called gemography - a service for finding remote jobs (I would assume they take a cut)

## Other things that might interest me

- Node or npm
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Logistics / postal service
