# Swift

Getting back into it after a few years away. I began by reading the 2022-09-12 version of The Swift Programming Language. TODO go through my highlights of that on Kindle

## Type system

### [WWDC 2022 110353 – Design protocol interfaces in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110353/)

I came into this wanting to know more about the `any MyProtocol` meaning, and also the meaning of "primary associated type", neither of which are explained in TSPL but which I'd heard elsewhere (possibly in this talk at some other time).

Builds on "Embrace Swift generics" talk, will watch that after

#### Understand type erasure

> "Let's start by learning how protocols with associated types interact with existential types."

`Animal` has an associated `CommodityType` that they `.produce()`, then we have a `Farm` with an array `var animals: [any Animal]`.

> "… the `any Animal` type has a box(ed?) representation that has the ability to store any type of animal dynamically"

> "…the strategy of using the same representation for different concrete types is called _type erasure_"

Now explains why `animals.map { $0.produce() }` returns `[any Food]`:

> "The return type of `produce()` is an associated type. When you call a method returning an associated type on an existential type, the compiler will use type erasure to determine the result type of the call. Type erasure replaces these associated types with corresponding existential types that have equivalent constraints."

The type `any Food` is called the _upper bound_ of the associated `CommodityType`.

Associated types appearing in the result of a function declaration are said to be in a _producing position_. Associated types in producing position are type erased to their upper bound.

On the other hand, associated int he parameter list of a function declaration are said to be in the _consuming position_ (e.g. `eat(_: FeedType)`)

> "type erasure does not allow us to work with associated types in consuming position. Instead you must unbox the existential `any` type by passing it to a function that takes an opaque `some` type.

#### Hide implementation details

We add `var isHungry: Bool` to `Animal`. We have `Farm.feedAnimals()` which feeds all the hungry animals. And a `hungryAnimals` property that initially returns `[any Animal]`, but which we decide to optimise by returning `animals.lazy.filter(\.isHungry)` and hence returns `LazyFilterSequence<[any Animal>]`. But the client doesn't care about this implementation detail.

So we can use an opaque result type to hide the concrete type. But if we just wrote `var hungryAnimals: some Collection` we'd be hiding _too much_ type information - we wouldn't know the collection’s `Element` type.

So we can use a _constrained result type_ (new in Swift 5.7). Written by applying type arguments in angle brackets after the protocol name, e.g. `some Collection<any Animal>`.

This works because the `Collection` protocol declares that the `Element` associated type is a _primary associated type_, which is declared in angle brackets after the protocol name:

```swift
protocol Collection<Element>: Sequence {
	associatedtype Element
	...
}
```

> "Often you'll see a correspondence between the primary associated types of a protocol and the generic parameters of a concrete type conforming to this protocol" – e.g. `Array<Element>`, `Set<Element>`

And in Swift 5.7 we have _constrained existential types_ (i.e. can now do `any Collection<Element>`.)

#### Identify type relationships

Imagine we have:

```swift
struct Cow: Animal {
	func eat(_: Hay) { ... }
}

struct Hay: AnimalFeed {
	static func grow() -> Alfalfa { ... }
}

struct Alfalfa: Crop {
	func harvest () -> Hay { ...
}

let cow: Cow = ...
let alfalfa = Hay.grow()
let hay = alfalfa.harvest()

cow.eat(hay)
```

and also similarly with `Scratch`, which we `grow()` to create `Millet`, which a `Chicken` can then `eat(:_)`.

So, how will `Farm`’s `feedAnimals()` work? It’s going to loop through its `hungryAnimals`, and call `feedAnimal(animal)`.

At that point, we need to "unbox the existential type", which seems to mean something (?) happening to turn `any Animal` into `some Animal`.

```swift
private func feedAnimal(_ animal: some Animal)`
```

But what does that implementation look like?

(By the way, I didn't see TSPL talking about using `some` in a producing position, but we're seeing it here…)

So we do this:

```swift
let crop = type(of: animal).FeedType.grow()
let feed = crop.harvest()
animal.eat(feed)
```

(Is that `type(of: animal)` known at compile time?)

But apparently this doesn't guarantee that we get back the same type of animal feed we started with.

Oh, looks like this is just getting at making sure we use a same-type requirement with a `where` clause:

```swift
associatedtype CropType: Crop where CropType.FeedType === Self
```

(I think this is nothing new, might have missed something here.)

### [WWDC 2022 110352 - Embrace Swift generics](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110352/)

This seems to be building up the thing from before of growing crops, which we then harvest, which we then feed to multiple animals. Starts with concrete example with a cow etc, and then shows how generics allow us to model this.

Says that this is a really common pattern:

```swift
func feed<A>(_ animal: A) where A: Animal
```

which can now be expressed (with identical meaning) in terms of the protocol conformance as

```swift
func feed(_ animal: some Animal)
```

(I think this is new in Swift 5.7.)

The specific underlying type that is substituted in to an opaque type is called the _underlying type_.

Local variables with opaque type must always have an initial value.

Think of `any Animal` as a box, formally called an _existential type_.

How do we call `animal.eat(_:)` on an `any Animal`? We need to unbox it – i.e. convert an instance of `any Animal ` to `some Animal` by _unboxing_ the existential type. "Opening type-erased boxes". New in Swift 5.7. (See the full implementation, using `type(of: animal` in the talk I described above.)

In general, write `some` by default.

## Concurency

### [WWDC 2021 10132 - Meet async/await in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10132/)

#### Basics

I _think_ this is a concept that is more simple than structured concurrency (that is, `Task`s and the language’s automatic management of their hierarchy, and the ability to manage a group of them). It's just the idea that a function is able to suspend its execution (that is, give up control of a thread but returning control to the system instead of the caller) for the system to resume it later. This is a concept which can be informally implemented via e.g. completion handlers, but then the language is unable to enforce things that it does for synchronous code, such as that a function either returns a value or throws an error. Notice also that this has nothing to do with actors, which although integrated with the concurrency system, are simply a means to protect mutable state.

Notice that [SE-0296 – Async/await](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0296-async-await.md#launching-async-tasks) says:

> Because only async code can call other async code, this proposal provides no way to initiate asynchronous code. This is intentional: all asynchronous code runs within the context of a "task", a notion which is defined in the Structured Concurrency proposal.

Read-only can be `async` too, e.g. `await maybeImage?.thumbnail`. They need an explicit getter so they can be marked `get async`. Initializers can be `async` too.

`await` also works in `for` loops for iterating over async sequences. See the "Meet AsyncSequence" section.

When a function resumes, there's no guarantee it'll do so on the same thread as before.

#### Testing

`XCTest` supports `async` test functions out of the box — removing the need for expectations.

(They don't address what to do if you'd like a timeout.)

#### Bridging from sync to async

How do you call async code in a context that doesn't support concurrency? This is where a taste of `Task` comes in.

```swift
Task {
  // something
}}
```

#### Existing APIs that take completion handlers

The compiler provides `async` alternatives to Objective-C methods that take completion handlers.

_Furthermore_, given delegate or data source methods that receive a completion handler (which are used to inform the framework when some work has completed), the compiler creates an `async` alternative.

> We recommend that `async` functions omit leading words like `get`, that communicate when the results of a call are not directly returned.

#### Async alternatives and continuations

To use a callback method inside an async function? Use `withCheckedThrowingContinuation`. The continuation has `resume(throwing:)` and `resume(returning:)` methods.

A continuation must be resumed exactly once – < 1 results in a warning, > 1 results in a fatal error.

### [WWDC 2021 10058 – Meet AsyncSequence](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058)

I thought perhaps it would be interesting to look at this next instead of going on to structured concurrency and actors, since, just like async/await, it's just another extension of existing synchronous programming ideas.

Unlocks the `for (try) await` syntax.

`AsyncSequence` has all the expected `Sequence` functionality like `map`, `reduce`, `dropFirst()`.

> `AsyncSequence` will suspend on each element, and resume when the underlying iterator produces a value or throws.

Unlike `Sequence`, they can throw an error.

I don't understand what happens if multiple people share an async sequence. Need a deeper dive into the documentation on this one.

Bear in mind that it's quite common for an async sequence not to terminate. (You might, for example, want to wrap the iteration in a separate `Task` in that case. That way, you can also externally cancel the iteration by cancelling the task. _Presumably_, iteration has no special handling of cancellation and you still need to cooperate and check for it.)

#### Iteration is not the only way to interact with an `AsyncSequence`

For example, you could `await center.notifications(named: …).first { … }`.

#### System frameworks

- `FileHandle` adds `bytes: AsyncBytes`
- there's an extension on `AsyncSequence` that converts an `AsyncSequence` of bytes into one of lines
- `URL` adds convenience `resourceBytes: AsyncBytes` and `lines: AsyncLineSequence<AsyncBytes>` async sequences.
- `URLSession` has instance method `func bytes(for: URLRequest) async throws -> (AsyncBytes, URLResponse)`
- Await notifications synchronously – `NotificationCenter` adds `func notifications(named: Notification.Name, object: AnyObject) -> Notifications`

#### How can I make my own `AsyncSequence`?

Let's see how to adapt existing patterns such as (callbacks / delegates) that are executed multiple times, which don't require any response back.

Our bridge to the `AsyncSequence` world is `AsyncStream`, which vends a continuation with a `yield` function (and also an `onTermination` which they just say "handles termination and cleanup" – one to understand better)

```swift
let quakes = AsyncStream(Quake.self) { continuation in
	let monitor = QuakeMonitor()
	monitor.quakeHandler = { quake in
		continuation.yield(quake)
	}
	continuation.onTermination = { _ in
		monitor.stopMonitoring()
	}
	monitor.startMonitoring()
}
```

So, something that's not clear to me is what the consequences are of the fact that simply creating this stream starts some work happening. Is that different to the way things work in Combine / Rx? I don't know enough about those models either to have much to say on this yet though.

Sounds like there's other stuff to understand about `AsyncSequence`, like how it handles buffering (and what that even means).

There's also `AsyncThrowingStream` if you want to be able to throw errors.

#### Language

I'm not sure what the correct language is that corresponds to concepts like "publish an element", if I wanted to document an API.

#### Time

I think — from seeing one of the Swift Evolution proposals — that async sequences are bound to some concept of time and of representing it. But that wasn't mentioned here. Another one to look into.

### [WWDC 2022 110355 – Meet Swift Async Algorithms](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110355/)

Sounds like this is the package that introduces interaction with `Clock`.

#### Multi-input algorithms

Combining async sequences into a single output

1. Zip

   Combines values into tuples. Rethrows errors. Each side is waited concurrently (i.e. one doesn't block the other)

2. Merge

   Combine multiple AsyncSequences into one AsyncSequence

   If any of the iterations produces an error, the other iterations are cancelled.

#### New Swift APIs for handling time

There are some APIs for leveraging the new `Clock`, `Instant` and `Duration` in Swift 5.7. Let's first understand what these types are.

- `Clock`: Protocol for defining time. Defines a way to wake up after a given instant and a concept of now. Two of the most common ones are `SuspendingClock` (stops when machine sleeps) and `ContinuousClock` (always runs). We have `clock.sleep(until:)` and `clock.measure { … }`.

#### Algorithms for handling time (in Async Algorithms package)

1. Debounce – `debounce(for: .milliseconds(300))`

   Awaits a quiescence period to produce events. Rethrows failures immediately. Used for example for rate limiting searches when user enters input

2. Chunks – groups elements into collections by count, time, or content

   e.g. `let batches = outboundMessages.chunked(by: .repeating(every: .milliseonds(500))`

   Used e.g. for batching requests to the server

#### Collection initializers

Initialize `Dictionary`, `Set` or `Array` from (known finite) async sequences

### WWDC 2021 10134 — Explore structured concurrency in Swift

_Structured programming_ is an idea we take for granted these days – it makes control flow more uniform. For example, it ties together control flow and variable lifetime.

Asynchronous code with completion handlers is _unstructured_. (I think that some of this we've already seen in the async/await talk – unable to throw errors, unable to use loops).

Let's continue beyond what we saw in the async/await talk. We've seen how to use async/await to generate thumbnails _sequentially_ in a loop. But want if we want to do it _concurrently_, so that multiple downloads can happen in parallel?

#### Tasks

You can create additional _tasks_ to add concurrency to a program. A task provides a fresh execution context to run asynchronous code. Each task runs concurrently with respect to other execution contexts.

They’ll be automatically scheduled to run in parallel when safe and efficient to do so.

Calling an `async` function does **not** create a task for the call. You create tasks _explicitly_.

#### Task hierarchy and cancellation

##### The task tree

Tasks form part of a hierarchy called a _task tree_.

**A parent task can only finish its work if all of its child tasks have finished**. This guarantee is fundamental to structured concurrency. It prevents you from accidentally leaking child tasks.

##### Cancellation and hierarchy

When a task is cancelled, all subtasks that are descendents of that task will be automatically cancelled too.

##### Cancellation is cooperative

Tasks are not stopped immediately when cancelled. They must check if they have been cancelled.

You can check for cancellation from anywhere, async or not. Design your code with cancellation in mind.

You can use `try Task.checkCancellation()`, which throws an error if the task is cancelled. You can also use `if Task.isCancelled`.

You might wish to return a partial result if a task is cancelled. If doing so, you **must** document this.

#### Flavours of tasks

They fall into two categories:

- structured tasks — "provide scoped, structured tasks"
  - async-let tasks
  - group tasks
- unstructured tasks
  - normal unstructured tasks
  - detached tasks

Here's a summary from the end of the talk:

<img src="/assets/images/WWDC-2021-10134-tasks-table.png" alt="table of Swift task types" style="width: 50rem">

##### Async-let tasks

`async let result = URLSession.shared.data(…)` – this creates a new task, a child of the task that created it.

You then need to `try [await] result`.

If one `async let` task fails before another one is awaited, Swift will automatically mark the un-awaited task as cancelled, and then await for it to finish, before ending the function.

##### Group tasks

Provides a _dynamic_ amount of concurrency. Use `withThrowingTaskGroup`.

Tasks added to a group **cannot outlive the scope of the block in which the group is defined**.

You add tasks to a group using `group.async`. Once added to a group, child tasks are executed immediately and in any order.

A task group will await all of its child tasks when it goes out of scope. If a child task fails, the other tasks in the groups will be cancelled.

##### Unstructured tasks

Not all tasks fit a structured pattern:

- some tasks need to launch from non-`async` contexts
- some tasks live beyond the confines of a single scope (e.g. a method call that puts an object into an active state)

We use the `Task { … }` initializer. "Swift will schedule the task to run on the main actor as the originating scope" (?)

These tasks "inherit actor isolation and priority of the the origin context" (?), but the lifetime is not confined to any scope. We must manually handle the things that structured concurrency would have handled automatically — cancellation and awaiting the result.

In their example, they show how to kick off a task in response to a `UICollectionView` telling us it's going to display a cell. They show that we can access the containing class’s mutable state (a dictionary) inside the task body without a compiler error, because "the delegate class is bound to the main actor (@MainActor), and the new task inherits that, so they will never run together in parallel". And they then cancel the task when the cell goes out of view (another delegate callback).

##### Detached tasks

Also unstructured, but they don't inherit anything from their originating context. In their example, they use it to write some thumbnails to a file. Use `Task.detached { … }`. You can pass e.g. `(priority: .background)`.

#### Static concurrency checking

For example, if you try to modify a dictionary inside the body of a task group, you’ll get a compiler error "mutation of captured var 'foo' in concurrently-executing code".

Task creation takes a closure of a new type `@Sendable`. Its body is not allowed to capture mutable variables. They should only capture value types, actors, or classes that implement their own synchronization.

See the session "Protect mutable state with Swift actors".

In the particular example in this talk, they instead make each task return a value, and then use a `for try await (id, thumbnail) in group` (the group conforms to `AsyncSequence`) in order to store the values in a dictionary — this loop runs sequentially.

### [WWDC 2021 10133 — Protect mutable state with Swift actors](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10133/)

```swift
struct Counter {
	// (...)
	mutating func increment() -> Int {
		// (...)
	}
}

var counter = Counter()
Task.detached { counter.increment() }
```

This gives the compiler error "Mutation of captured var 'counter' in concurrently-executing code".

_Actors_ provide synchronization for shared mutable state. They isolate their state from the rest of the program. All access to that state goes through the actor, which ensures mutually-exclusive access to its state.

They are a new type of reference type in Swift.

External interactions with an actor must be performed _asynchronously_ (i.e. with `await`).

Calls _within_ an actor are synchronous, and synchronous code always runs uninterrupted.

#### Actor reentrancy

OK, synchronous code runs uninterrupted, but actors often interact with each other, or with other asynchronous code in the system.

I do not understand the example they are showing here. They have two separate tasks accessing the actor's shared image cache separately. It has something to do with the fact that there’s a suspension point in the middle where they fetch an image. "We don't have any low-level data races, but because we carried assumptions about state across an `await`, we ended up with a potential bug." **But why did it allow two tasks to be executing the same method on the actor simultaneously?**

"Actor reentrancy prevents deadlocks and guarantees forward progress, but it requires you to check your assumptions across each `await`."

To design well for reentrancy:

- Perform mutation of actor state in synchronous code, ideally within a synchronous function, so all state changes are well encapsulated.
- "State changes can involve temporarily putting our actor into an inconsistent state. Make sure to restore consistency before an `await`."
- Expect that the actor state could change during suspension — the program and world will move in while you're resumed.
- Check your assumptions after an `await` (e.g. about global state, clocks, …)

#### Actor isolation

##### Protocol conformance

e.g. making an actor conform to `Equatable`.

```swift
extension LibraryAccount: Equatable {
	static func ==(lhs: LibraryAccount, rhs: LibraryAccount) -> Bool {
		lhs.idNumber == rhs.idNumber
	}
}
```

Although it's a static function performing this check, it's OK, because it's only accessing immutable state of the actor.

_But_, now let's consider trying to implement `Hashable`, which requires a _synchronous instance method_ `hash(into: hasher: inout Hasher)`. But that gives the error "actor-isolated method `hash(into:)` cannot satisfy synchronous requirement". To fix this, we add the `nonisolated` keyword to the method. This means that the method will be treated as being outside the actor, even though it syntactially is inside the actor.

##### Closures

"Like functions, a closure might be actor isolated, or it might be nonisolated."

This means that, for example, we can have an actor method that calls `someArray.reduce { someOtherActorMethod() }`, because we know it's going to execute synchronously. The closure is _isolated to the actor_.

But, if, for example, we instead of `someArray.reduce` we use `Task.detached`, we need to use `await someOtherActorMethod()` inside the closure. The closure is _not_ isolated to the actor.

**(I don't know if these concepts of "(not) isolated to the actor" are some sort of attribute of the type or if it's something more contextual than that)**

#### Passing data into and out of actors

What if we passed a instance of a mutable class into an actor, and the actor then returned this value to something outside the actor? Then we'd have a handle into mutable state inside the actor.

Types that are safe to use concurrently are `Sendable` types. They can be shared across actors.

Many different kinds of types are `Sendable`:

- Value types
- Actor types
- Immutable classes
- Internally-synchronized class (e.g. with a lock to ensure safe concurrent access)
- `@Sendable` function types (we'll return to these)

`Sendable` describes a common but not universal property of types. Swift will eventually prevent non-`Sendable` types from being shared (it will become an error to pass a non-`Sendable` type across actor boundaries).

To declare a type as `Sendable`, add a conformance to that property. Swift will then check that this makes sense (e.g. by checking the properties). Similar to other protocols, we can propagate `Sendable` by adding a conditional conformance.

##### `@Sendable` functions

It places the following restrictions on closures:

- no mutable captures
- captures must be of `Sendable` type (to make sure that the closure cannot be used to move non-`Sendable` types across actor boundaries
- cannot be both synchronous and actor-isolated (because that would allow code to be run on the actor from the outside) **(same question as before about what this actor-isolated thing means)**

We've been relying on this attribute already, e.g.

```swift
static func detached(operation: @Sendable () async -> Success) -> Task<Success, Never>
```

So, the "Mutation of captured var 'counter' in concurrently-executing code" error we saw at the beginning comes before `detached` expects a `@Sendable` closure, but it's trying to capture a mutable variable.

#### The main actor

There's a special actor called the _main actor_. (\*\*I don't really understand what the word "actor" means when used here, and how it's related to the concept of actor — i.e. types declared with the `actor` keyword — we've seen so far; are they the same thing or do they just have the same general principle of synchronisation? e.g. what would be the main actor's mutable shared state and is access to it enforced?)

"Interacting with the main thread is a whole lot like interacting with an actor — if you know you're already running on the main thread, you can safely access and update your UI state. If you aren't running on the main thread, you need to interact with it asynchronously. This is exactly how actors work".

There's a special actor to represent the main thread, called the _main actor_.

It differs from a normal actor in two important ways:

1. performs all of its synchronization through the main dispatch queue
2. code and data that needs to be run on the main thread is scattered _everywhere_ (frameworks etc) — so you can mark a declaration with the `@MainActor` attribute to say that it must be executed on the main actor. If you call it from outside the main actor, you need to `await`.

Types can also be placed on the main actor (with `@MainActor`) — this implies that all methods and properties of the type are `MainActor`. Individual members can be opted out with `nonisolated`.

**How does this interact with framework types? Are they already marked? Their example shows `@MainActor class MyViewController: UIViewController`.**

### [WWDC 2022 110351 — Eliminate data races using Swift Concurrency](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110351/)

A bunch of stuff about boats and pineapples and chickens. Goes over stuff from last year’s actor talk.

#### `Sendable` constraints in Task APIs

Wherever tasks can exchange data, there is a `Sendable` constraint. For example `struct Task<Success: Sendable, Failure: Error> { ... }`.

#### `Sendable` inference

Inferred (e.g. for structs with `Sendable` properties) by the compiler for non-public types.

#### `Sendable` checking for classes

Classes can only be made `Sendable` under very narrow circumstances — e.g. when a final class only has immutable storage.

You can implement reference types that perform their own internal synchronisation. They’re conceptually `Sendable` but the compiler has no way to reason about it. You can mark the types as `@unchecked Sendable` in this case.

**(I don't really understand how to use thread-related synchronisation mechanisms to implement `Sendable` — does that not require some understanding of how Swift’s runtime uses threads to implement concurrency?)**

#### Actors provide mutual exclusion

**Only one task can execute on an actor at a time** — is this something that might help me understand the re-entrancy thing that confused me in last year’s actor’s session? When an actor method suspends, is the calling task no longer considered to be executing on the actor?

#### How to know what code is actor-isolated?

"Actor isolation is determined by the context you're in".

- Instance properties and methods are isolated to the actor (by default)
- Closures that are not `@Sendable` stay on the actor and are actor isolated when they're in an actor isolated context
- The `Task` initializer inherits actor isolation from its context (the created task will be scheduled on the same actor as it was initiated from) **What — I don't get this; what does it even mean to be "scheduled on an actor"?** Their example shows some mutable actor state being accesesed inside `Task { ... }`’s closure.
- A detached task does inherit actor isolation from its context, and hence needs to use `await`. This closure is called _non-isolated code_.

Non-isolated code is code that does not run on any actor at all. You can explicitly make an actor’s method `nonisolated` (we know this bit already).

"Non-isolated async code executes on the global cooperative pool" (what?)

The phrase "isolation domain" is used (?)

#### Applying the `@MainActor` attribute to a closure

```swift
Task { @MainActor in
	...
}
```

#### Atomicity

"The goal of the Swift concurrency model is to eliminate data races. What that really means is that it eliminates _low-level_ data races, which involve data corruption. You still need to reason about atomicity at a higher level".

As we said, actors run one task at a time. But, when you stop running on an actor, it can run other tasks. This ensures that the program makes progress, eliminating the potential for deadlocks. This requires you to consider your actor's invariants carefully around `await` statements. Otherwise you can end up with a _high-level_ data race, where the program is in an unexpected state even though no data is corrupted.

But the example they show here is an async function that fetches an island’s food asynchronously, then adds something to it, then sets the food. (This is different to the reentrancy thing we saw before, right?)

(First of all, the Swift compiler will reject an attempt to outright modify an actor-isolated property from outside a non-isolated context.)

Think in terms of _synchronous_ , _transactional_ operations. Keep async actor operations simple. Take care that your actor is in a good state at each `await` operation.

#### Ordering

Programs often rely in handling events in a consistent order — e.g. user input, messages from a server. Effects of each event should appear in the order they happened.

Actors are _not_ the tool for this. They’re not strictly first-in, first-out, and execute the highest-priority work first.

Tools for ordering:

- tasks run code in order
- `AsyncStream` delivers elements in order

#### `@preconcurrency import`

Silence `Sendable` warnings for types from an imported module, by using `@preconcurrency import FarmAnimals`.

#### Complete Strict Concurrency Checking

This will check things like sending a non-`Sendable` closure even to a dispatch queue, for example.

### [WWDC 2021 10254 — Swift concurrency: Behind the scenes](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10254/)

#### Threading model

Let's start by thinking about how it currently works in GCD.

When work is enqueued on a GCD queue, the system brings up a thread to service it — and on a concurrent queue it will do so up to the number of cores. But if a thread blocks and there is more work to be done on the concurrent queue, GCD brings up more threads to drain the remaining work items — to ensure that each core continues to have a thread that executes work at any time, and also to potentially help unblock the blocked thread.

This can lead to lots of threads (I’m being vague, they have a proper explained example), known as thread explosion (see previous WWDC talks about risks e.g. deadlock, memory overhead (stack etc), context switching. As blocked threads become available again, the scheduler has to timeshare the threads (which for reasons I didn't fully follow is not a good thing in excess).

Now let's think about Swift concurrency, which is "built with performance in mind".

In Swift, there are no thread context switches, and no blocked threads. Instead we have lightweight objects known as _continuations_ to track the progress of work. We now only pay the cost of a function call instead.

Swift only creates as many threads as there are CPU cores.

Swift's concurrency model and semantics have been designed with the guarantee that threads will not block.

Relevant language features:

- `await` and non-blocking of threads
- tracking of dependencies in Swift task model

They then go into some details of how the call stack works with `await` (local variables stored in async frame on heap, current stack frame replaced)

Runtime contract: threads are always able to make forward progress.

Integrated OS support: new cooperative thread pool, default executor for Swift, width limited to the number of CPU cores.

#### Adoption of Swift concurrency

1. Concurrency comes with costs — ensure that benefits of concurrency outweighs costs of managing it.
2. `await` and atomicity — no guarantee that the thread which executed the code before the `await` will execute the continuation as well
   - so do not hold locks across `await`
   - thread specific data is not preserved across an `await`
3. runtime contract: forward progress of threads (not sure exactly what that means). Use safe primitives like `await`, actors, task groups. Primitives like `os_unfair_lock` and `NSLock` in synchronous code are safe for locking, in a tightly controlled critical section "because the thread holding the lock is always able to make forward progress towards releasing the lock; as such, while the primitive might block the thread for a short period of time under contention, it does not violate the runtime contract of forward progress" (?)

## Swift Package Manager

### [WWDC 2022 110359 – Meet Swift Package plugins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110359/)

A Swift script that can perform actions on a Swift package. Uses a special API provided for this purpose.

They're themselves implemented as Swift packages. A plugin can use more than one source file. A Swift package can define more than one plugin. Specialized packages can be private to the package that provides it. But also can be made public by defining it as a package product.

There are two kinds:

- Command plugins
  - Run whenever you want to, e.g. format source code, or prepare for distribution. In general, things you might have arbitrary scripts for today
  - Can ask for permission to modify files in the package (useful for formatting)
  - But might also not need any write permissions, e.g. to just generate stats.
- Build tool plugins
  - Extend the build system’s dependency graph
  - For e.g. generating source code

#### An example of using a command plugin

Accessible from the right-click menu on `Package.swift` in Xcode. It then asks you which of the targets you wish to pass to the plugin. You can choose to invoke on the whole package. You can also pass custom arguments to the plugin.

You can also use the `swift package plugin` subcommand. `swift package plugin --list` to list the action verbs, and `swift package <verb>` to invoke plugin.

#### How do they work?

Each plugin runs as a separate process (in a sandbox that prevents network access and only has limited file system write access, e.g. build outputs directory). They have access to:

- a distilled representation of the input package, including its source files
- information about the package’s dependencies

Plugins can extend sandbox, ask for permission to also modify files in the package source directory.

Plugins can emit warnings and errors.

The `PackagePlugin` provides the APIs.

```swift
@main
struct MyPlugin: CommandPlugin {
	// Entry points specific to package capability
}
```

#### More about command plugins

- They’re run interactively, not during a build
- Usually depend on other tools to do the actual work
- "Xcode will build any required tools from source"

#### More about build plugins

- Supports build command and prebuild commands
- Output files are stored with other build artifacts, not among package sources
- The entry point is the `createBuildCommands(context: PluginContext, target: Target) throws -> [Command]`
- The two types of build commands:
  - Build commands run as part of the build, they specify their input and output paths, and are only run when outputs missing or inputs change
  - Prebuild commands run before _every_ build starts and can generate outputs whose names can't be known beforehand

To specify which build tool plugins to apply to a package target, there's a new `plugins` parameter available on targets in `Package.swift`.

I wonder if there's a way to preview the generated code?
