# Free and open-source software

## Projects

- [FreeSewing](https://freesewing.org/) - they have contributor calls you can join on Discord
- [Kimai](https://www.kimai.org/) - I use this for my timesheets / invoicing for freelance work
- until I fill this list in more, my [`Brewfile`](https://github.com/lawrence-forooghian/dotfiles/blob/main/Brewfile) is a good starting point for a sample of what I’m using

## In Brazil

- Wikipedia’s [list of events in Brazil](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_eventos_de_software_livre#Eventos_no_Brasil)
- [ConFLOSS](https://confloss.com.br): Conferência de Free/Libre e Open Source Software
