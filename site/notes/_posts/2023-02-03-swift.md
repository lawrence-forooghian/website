# Swift

Getting back into it after a few years away. I began by reading the 2022-09-12 version of The Swift Programming Language. TODO go through my highlights of that on Kindle

## Type system

### [WWDC 2022 110353 – Design protocol interfaces in Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110353/)

I came into this wanting to know more about the `any MyProtocol` meaning, and also the meaning of "primary associated type", neither of which are explained in TSPL but which I'd heard elsewhere (possibly in this talk at some other time).

Builds on "Embrace Swift generics" talk, will watch that after

#### Understand type erasure

> "Let's start by learning how protocols with associated types interact with existential types."

`Animal` has an associated `CommodityType` that they `.produce()`, then we have a `Farm` with an array `var animals: [any Animal]`.

> "… the `any Animal` type has a box(ed?) representation that has the ability to store any type of animal dynamically"

> "…the strategy of using the same representation for different concrete types is called _type erasure_"

Now explains why `animals.map { $0.produce() }` returns `[any Food]`:

> "The return type of `produce()` is an associated type. When you call a method returning an associated type on an existential type, the compiler will use type erasure to determine the result type of the call. Type erasure replaces these associated types with corresponding existential types that have equivalent constraints."

The type `any Food` is called the _upper bound_ of the associated `CommodityType`.

Associated types appearing in the result of a function declaration are said to be in a _producing position_. Associated types in producing position are type erased to their upper bound.

On the other hand, associated int he parameter list of a function declaration are said to be in the _consuming position_ (e.g. `eat(_: FeedType)`)

> "type erasure does not allow us to work with associated types in consuming position. Instead you must unbox the existential `any` type by passing it to a function that takes an opaque `some` type.

#### Hide implementation details

We add `var isHungry: Bool` to `Animal`. We have `Farm.feedAnimals()` which feeds all the hungry animals. And a `hungryAnimals` property that initially returns `[any Animal]`, but which we decide to optimise by returning `animals.lazy.filter(\.isHungry)` and hence returns `LazyFilterSequence<[any Animal>]`. But the client doesn't care about this implementation detail.

So we can use an opaque result type to hide the concrete type. But if we just wrote `var hungryAnimals: some Collection` we'd be hiding _too much_ type information - we wouldn't know the collection’s `Element` type.

So we can use a _constrained result type_ (new in Swift 5.7). Written by applying type arguments in angle brackets after the protocol name, e.g. `some Collection<any Animal>`.

This works because the `Collection` protocol declares that the `Element` associated type is a _primary associated type_, which is declared in angle brackets after the protocol name:

```swift
protocol Collection<Element>: Sequence {
	associatedtype Element
	...
}
```

> "Often you'll see a correspondence between the primary associated types of a protocol and the generic parameters of a concrete type conforming to this protocol" – e.g. `Array<Element>`, `Set<Element>`

And in Swift 5.7 we have _constrained existential types_ (i.e. can now do `any Collection<Element>`.)

#### Identify type relationships

Imagine we have:

```swift
struct Cow: Animal {
	func eat(_: Hay) { ... }
}

struct Hay: AnimalFeed {
	static func grow() -> Alfalfa { ... }
}

struct Alfalfa: Crop {
	func harvest () -> Hay { ...
}

let cow: Cow = ...
let alfalfa = Hay.grow()
let hay = alfalfa.harvest()

cow.eat(hay)
```

and also similarly with `Scratch`, which we `grow()` to create `Millet`, which a `Chicken` can then `eat(:_)`.

So, how will `Farm`’s `feedAnimals()` work? It’s going to loop through its `hungryAnimals`, and call `feedAnimal(animal)`.

At that point, we need to "unbox the existential type", which seems to mean something (?) happening to turn `any Animal` into `some Animal`.

```swift
private func feedAnimal(_ animal: some Animal)`
```

But what does that implementation look like?

(By the way, I didn't see TSPL talking about using `some` in a producing position, but we're seeing it here…)

So we do this:

```swift
let crop = type(of: animal).FeedType.grow()
let feed = crop.harvest()
animal.eat(feed)
```

(Is that `type(of: animal)` known at compile time?)

But apparently this doesn't guarantee that we get back the same type of animal feed we started with.

Oh, looks like this is just getting at making sure we use a same-type requirement with a `where` clause:

```swift
associatedtype CropType: Crop where CropType.FeedType === Self
```

(I think this is nothing new, might have missed something here.)

### [WWDC 2022 110352 - Embrace Swift generics](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110352/)

This seems to be building up the thing from before of growing crops, which we then harvest, which we then feed to multiple animals. Starts with concrete example with a cow etc, and then shows how generics allow us to model this.

Says that this is a really common pattern:

```swift
func feed<A>(_ animal: A) where A: Animal
```

which can now be expressed (with identical meaning) in terms of the protocol conformance as

```swift
func feed(_ animal: some Animal)
```

(I think this is new in Swift 5.7.)

The specific underlying type that is substituted in to an opaque type is called the _underlying type_.

Local variables with opaque type must always have an initial value.

Think of `any Animal` as a box, formally called an _existential type_.

How do we call `animal.eat(_:)` on an `any Animal`? We need to unbox it – i.e. convert an instance of `any Animal ` to `some Animal` by _unboxing_ the existential type. "Opening type-erased boxes". New in Swift 5.7. (See the full implementation, using `type(of: animal` in the talk I described above.)

In general, write `some` by default.
