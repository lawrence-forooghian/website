# Email

Here are some things that Iâ€™ve found out about email. I'd like to understand its history and then the state of the art.

It's a federated system (I found this out from [The unrealized potential of federation](https://drewdevault.com/2020/09/20/The-potential-of-federation.html)).

Other things I read around this time:

- [WhatsApp and the domestication of users](https://seirdy.one/2021/01/27/whatsapp-and-the-domestication-of-users.html)
- [Protocols, Not Platforms: A Technological Approach to Free Speech](https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech)

[Message transfer agents](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_transfer_agent) transfer messages to each other using SMTP ([RFC 5321](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321)).

The messages they transfer conform to the Internet Message Format ([RFC 5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322)).

When reading about [why Fastmail won't incorporate PGP support](https://www.reddit.com/r/fastmail/comments/9koz2u/server_side_pgp_public_key_encryption/):

- [DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) allows adding a `DKIM-Signature` header to sign the email to prove the sender. To find the public key of the sender, look up a specially-named TXT record e.g. `brisbane._domainkey.example.net`
- [DMARC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) and [SPF](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC) also have something to do with combatting spoofing, but I haven't looked into them yet
- [MTA STS](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/answer/What-is-MTA-STS-and-how-will-it-improve-email-security) is something to do with encryption between MTAs

It's interesting how many things rely on putting data in DNS records.
