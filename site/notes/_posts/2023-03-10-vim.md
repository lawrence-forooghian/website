# Vim

Some useful things:

- To paste a register into the command area, do `CTRL-R` and then the register name.
  - This equally works when you’re in insert mode (handy for when you don’t want to enter normal mode just to paste something)
- Useful registers:
  - The default register when you yank is named `"`
  - Current file path is in register named `%`
  - Last search expression is in register named `/`
- To copy registers from one to another (e.g. to copy the name of the file from one buffer and put it elsewhere): `:let @a=@b`
