### Jon “maddog” Hall – What Next?

Board Chair, Linux Professional Instituve

- '76/77 copyright started to be applied to software

Solutions (what people want):

- ERP/POS: ODOO.com
- Kodi.tv: Smart TV
- Freedombox.org: a personal / community server, e.g. NAS, Fediverse party. Created by Ebden Moglen (wrote GPL)
- home-assistant.io: home / office / business automation (local control)

Could set these up as businesses to make money

RISC-V architecture (from Berkeley)

My question: might there be a day when any software developer who wishes to do so could make a living developing FOSS?

His answer: businesses have moulded their processes to meet the abilities of software. 80% of needs for 80% of people. Need OSS so you can change software.

Some OSS companies he knows in Brazil:

- Open S – telecoms
- iSolv (now Weon?) – OSS apps for iOS / Android

Cesar Brod & Galvão Abbott

Marcus Vinicus Manzona – longtime friend of Maddog and supporter

There’s also Latino TALKS, every Thurs 20h.
