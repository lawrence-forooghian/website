## PDF metadata that Kindle displays

These are the names of the Calibre fields.

- File name
  - This is currently populated by Calibre, in "Title - Author name" form, which isn’t what I want.
  - We can change it using the "Sending books to devices" section in Calibre’s preferences. Let’s try removing ` - {authors}` from that. Yep, that seems to have worked.
- Author(s) – the field in Calibre

Seems like to get it to refresh on the Kindle you need to delete from device and re-send. (I think I’ve misunderstood this, though.)
